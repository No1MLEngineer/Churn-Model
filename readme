*Customer Churn Prediction Project*

---

**Project Overview**

This project aims to predict which customers are likely to stop using a companyâ€™s product or service (churn) using historical customer data and machine learning. By identifying customers at risk of churning, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them and boost revenue.

---

**Problem Statement**

Customer retention is crucial for business growth. Losing customers (churn) can hurt profits, so predicting churn early helps companies focus their retention efforts and improve customer satisfaction.

---

**Dataset**

The dataset includes features like:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Membership Duration
- Number of Visits per Month
- Average Spending
- Coupon Usage
- Churn Label (1 if the customer churned, 0 otherwise)

You can use a public dataset (like the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle) or your own data.

**Project Steps**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Visualize how different features relate to churn (e.g., do customers with fewer visits churn more?).

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   Create new features if needed (like average spend per visit).

4. **Model Building:**  
   Split the data into training and testing sets. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict churn.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

6. **Interpretation:**  
   Identify which features are most important for predicting churn.

7. **Recommendations:**  
   Suggest actions the business can take to reduce churn (e.g., reward loyal customers, target at-risk groups).

**Results**

The model predicts which customers are likely to churn with a certain accuracy. Feature importance analysis shows which factors (like low visit frequency or low spending) are strong indicators of churn.
